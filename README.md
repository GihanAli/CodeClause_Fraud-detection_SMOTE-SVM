# CodeClause_Fraud-detection_SMOTE_CS-SVM
This project is concerned with the credit card fraud detection in imbalanced data. Particularly, the project aims at proposing a novel model referred to as SMOTE-CS-SVM integrating the application of The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with Cost sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM). Importantly, the results reveal the superiority of the proposed model over other state-of-the-art imbalanced classifiers in terms of accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.
